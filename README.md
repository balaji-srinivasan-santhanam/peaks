peak calling (ChIP-seq)


Please note:
The R script provides a method for peak calling for ChIP-seq data. These analyses were originally developed in [Dr. Gad Shaulsky's]( https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/gad-shaulsky-30425) lab at [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/). The original code was developed for ChIP-seq analyses in the A/T-rich genome of the soil amoeba *Dictyostelium discoideum*, the results of which are published [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8551). The analyses were inspired from and built on approaches described in several popular peak calling methods including MACS and SISSRs. A modified version of the original code is presented here.
